INSTRUCTIONS
============
Building
  Extract the contents of jtumblr.zip.  From a command line, navigate 
  to the folder "jtumblr".  Once there, type the command: 

	ant

  Ant should read the appropriate build.xml, and compile the source 
  code.  In addition, a runnable jar file will be created.

Running
  The newly created jar file should be run from the command line. To
  do so, use the -jar option with java:

	java -jar jtumblr.jar
	
  This will print a help message for the jtumblr application.  In
  order to query tumblr for particular posts, use one or more of the
  options defined in the help message.  For example:
  
  	java -jar jtumblr.jar -num all newsweek artinmycoffee
  	
  Will query all the posts from newsweek.tumblr.com and 
  artinmycoffee.tumblr.com, and return summary statistics on those 
  posts.

FEATURES
========
 *Use all of the GET parameters, except for "state" (requires 
  authentication), defined by the tumblr api: 
  http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api to retrieve posts of interest.
 *Query multiple tumblr blogs if they exist as a subdomain of 
  tumblr.com.
 *Retrieve any number of posts from a blog, as long as they exist.  
  Specify "all" to retrieve all of that blog's posts.
 *Three summary statistics are available:
 	-Number of posts made during each hour of the day.
 	-Number of posts for each post-type.
 	-Number of posts for each tag that occurs.
 *Display total number of posts retrieved.
 *Print post content from one post or from all of those queried.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
  *Only one url may be provided with the -url option.  In addition,
   when using -url num cannot be all, and must be less than or equal
   to 50.
  *Tumblr may deny further requests for a period if too many
   requests are made.  An http 500 or 503 error is returned
   by the program when this occurs.
  *There is an "answer" post-type that is not handled by the
   program.  A generic Post class is created when one of these
   post-types is encountered.
  *If the parser encounters a post-type that is not defined or
   included in the PostType Enum, the program may crash.
  *For PhotoPosts containing more than one photo, only the primary 
   photo-url is handled correctly.
  *If one of the dimensions of a photo resolution is greater than
   1280, that larger photo size is discarded.  Instead, the
   TumblrPhoto class will only store the link to the smaller version
   of the photo (dimensions less than or equal to 1280).
  *Cases where there is not internet connection is not handled by the
   program.
